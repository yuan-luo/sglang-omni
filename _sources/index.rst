SGLang-Omni
=======================

SGLang-Omni is an ecosystem project for SGLang.
Omni models refer to models that have multi-modal inputs and multi-modal outputs.
These models typically consist of multiple stages, making SGLang's LLM-specific architecture no longer suitable.
Therefore, SGLang-Omni is designed to provide the ability to orchestrate multi-stage pipeline with high performance and real-time API support.
Our core features include:

- Native Integration with SGLang for performance
- Multi-Stage Pipeline Framework for Omni Models
- OpenAI-Compatible Server with Real-Time API support
